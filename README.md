## About

The Carew Beer Review! 
A review of the beers at the yearly Carew Arms Beer Festival in Crowcombe in Somerset. A real ale festival with 18 different beers to try over the weekend. 

## Project Target

The website aims to address the need to review the beers at the recent beer festival at the Carew Arms in Somerset. There were 18 beers to taste over the course of a weekend. There were also ciders but the current scope is too only focus on the beers. 

The website will address this problem by providing separate options for each beer to read details of each beer and allow a user to leave a comment review and a score for each beer. The reviews will then be displayed alongside each beer on the beer page, and the score will also display on the card for each beer. 

The target audience for this website is largely attendees of the festival who were interested in rating the beers. However as the beers are also available in the wider public this could also be a resource for them to check and leave a comment for. Once created it could easily be adapted to be ready in time for next years festival, so that it can be updated during the weekend as well.

# Design Aims

The aim of the design is to make it really simple, clear and straightforward as to what the site is used for. A simple main landing page displaying the title with "CarewFest Beers & Reviews". 

# Main Page

Before the user accesses the page they will have to confirm they are 18 years old as the subject matter is age restricted (alcohol/beer)./ 
The main page will host a selection of beers in bootstrap cards which are also links, hosted in a carousel so each beer can be moved between with clear arrows to enable this decision. By clicking on each beer the user will get more information and access to the reviews, an option to leave their own reviews. 
The site does not encourage excessive drinking and is a means to share information on beers at the festival. Drink Responsibly.
