## About

The Carew Beer Review! 
A review of the beers at the yearly Carew Arms Beer Festival in Crowcombe in Somerset. A real ale festival with 18 different beers to try over the weekend. 

## Proget Target

The website aims to address the need to review the beers at the recent beer festival at the Carew Arms in Somerset. There were 18 beers to taste over the course of a weekend. There were also ciders but the current scope is too only focus on the beers. 

The website will address this problem by providing separate options for each beer to read details of each beer and allow a user to leave a comment review and a score for each beer. The reviews will then be displayed alongside each beer on the beer page, and the score will also display on the card for each beer. 

The target audience for this website is largely attendees of the festival who were interested in rating the beers. However as the beers are also available in the wider public this could also be a resource for them to check and leave a comment for. Once created it could easily be adapted to be ready in time for next years festival, so that it can be updated during the weekend as well.
